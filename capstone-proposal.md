# ChemEd Simulations Proposal
_By: Seth Gonzales_


### Project's Purpose or Goal: 
 * This application will be build for science (mainly chemistry) classrooms who are looking for access to chemistry simulations to enriching student learning. 

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
 * This application will...
    * Greet students with an opening splash page that gives information about the site and offers links to sign-up/in and access simulations.
    * Create separate components for student login and registration. 
    * Authorize and authenticate student accounts. Only allow access to simulations if registered. 
    * Host at least one simulation:
      * States of matter simulation: Simulation will show a container of particles that are moving at different speeds based on their states of matter. Students will have the ability to increase or decrease the temperature of the container and as a result change the speed and state of matter of the particles.
    * Follow strong,thorough, clean design 
  
### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
  * React - use for project structuring
  * JavaScript - use for back-end logic and for simulation animations (may need to use three.js as well)
  * Firestore - application hosting and backend database(?)
  * css - project design 
  * html 

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
  * Add additional simulations for students to access.
  * Add additional features to the states of matter simulations:
    * intermolecular forces
    * different atoms/molecules to choose from

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
  * Potentially three.js

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
  * Nope!
